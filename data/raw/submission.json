I have a Tidal subscription and I decided to do this: I'll let you request anything that is available on Tidal and I will try my best to rip it. :) There are a few things that need to be mentioned:  \n\n\n* The quality will be HiFi Flac or lower where HiFi is not available\n* You can request anything: artist, album, ep, single, etc. \n* In case something is not available on my Tidal or there is any problem, I will try my best to solve it but in case that I cannot honor your request, I am sorry.\n* I saw that these sort of posts gain a lot of traction on this subreddit so please be patient.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now for the hard part: I saw that a lot of the links get taken down for obvious reasons and I developed a sharing mechanism that I hope will be more effective in avoiding takedown. It is not a difficult process but it is lengthy and I hope that you understand the reasoning behind it.  \n\n\nHow the process goes:  \n\n\n* You request *something*\n* I gather said *thing*\n* I compress said *thing*, encrypt it and then upload it in two places (links will appear at different times as soon as I get them because of slower upload speeds in one of the places)\n   * a place where the link will expire anywhere between 1-30 days or after a certain amount of downloads (which is usually pretty fast)\n   * a place where the link will expire if not downloaded in 10 days (if downloaded often it should last a long time but the con is that the speed is pretty slow)\n* I give you a *thing* to which you need to do the following\n\n1. go to a [site](https://unenc.com/) that supports decrypting the Rijndael 256 cypher\n2. decrypt the *thing* with the [UNIX](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) timestamp corresponding to the date of your comment at the 00:00:00 timestamp. (try 1 day before / after if you get weird results, it might be because of your timezone)\n3. get the link and the date from the *thing* \n4. go to the link and input the UNIX timestamp corresponding to the date found from the *thing* as the password\n5. download the *thing* and then go the site that starts with a three letter word that is a type of vestimentary article which is put on the head and that ends with .sh and decrypt the *thing* with the UNIX timestamp corresponding to the date found at step 3 but reversed. (1234 -&gt; 4321)\n6. You should have an archive with your *things*, enjoy.  \n\n\nI do realise that this process is very lengthy and probably overkill, but I again ask you to please understand the reason behind me doing it.

Michael releases his hold and watches white strands streak through the air, crushing some cars in the distance that were trying to escape the town. The unfortunate drivers\u2019 cars are flooded with the heavy seed, glass breaking, metal bending, wheels sliding. They are forced to gulp down an absurd amount of thick and meaty tasting cum to try and survive, but it was too much for them to handle, and they drowned in Jason\u2019s seed.\r\n\r\nWith Jason recovering from his climax, Michael proceeds to grow until he is slightly taller than the other giant, just like before. He grabs Jason by the shoulder and communicates with him in silence. The hockey masked giant nods in understanding, looking to a nearby city with flashing lights, new prey awaiting them. The two look at each other and nod, their cocks hardening.\r\n\r\nThe city of Vineland remained in bliss for a moment, unaware of what lurked within the night sky. A danger was approaching, but the people didn\u2019t know that. They went about their business in unwilling ignorance of the two monsters approaching them in the backdrop of darkness provided by the cold night sky. \r\n\r\nThen, one person sets eyes on foggy figures looming in the distance, the unmistakable outlines of giants. Two men, massive in size, easily dwarfing the tallest buildings in the world were drawing closer. Their footsteps shook the sky like thunder and the ground like an earthquake. They were quickly closing the distance between them and Vineland, the city sure to not stand a chance against their wrath.\r\n\r\n\u201cMonster!\u201d the bystander screams as loud as their voice could go. Everyone looks out into the distance to see the massive figures approaching. Police and military forces quickly gather in preparation to defend the city and its people. Tanks and helicopters gather at the outskirts of the city. Some of the more poorly built tanks are knocked to the ground by the intense quakes from the massive feet of the killers that were now only 5 steps away from the city.\r\n\r\nCannons fire at the bodies of the two colossal killers but have no effect whatsoever, not even gaining the attention of the men. Helicopters whir in the air, the soldiers stationed in them firing their weapons. Machine guns and rockets launch at the two titans, but the bullets roll off their muscular bodies and the rockets don\u2019t even shave off dead skin. \r\n\r\nJason and Michael reach Vineland, their toes crushing powerlines, their toenails cutting through buildings like sawblades. Tanks and cars are all laid to waste under the mighty feet of the unstoppable giants. The two survey the land before them, the lights of the city quickly going out without power, leaving the masses to scurry about in the darkness. \r\n\r\nThe two giants walk forward, crushing streets and buildings effortlessly beneath their wide and dirty soles. Jason takes the most joy in crushing, not able to see the specks scurrying about at his height, but he knew they were, and that made him hard. As he was doing that, Michael was gathering people to entertain the two. He brought himself low to the ground and began to glide his hand across the earth, scooping up the remains of buildings and terrified people. Many were crushed beneath his glove, the titan not knowledgeable of their existence and would not have cared if he was. When he finished, he proceeds to rise back up, providing a bad case of vertigo for all the people he carried.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold your fire!\u201d the captain of the helicopter swarm orders over the radio. \u201cHe\u2019s got hostages! Some of you need to get in close and retrieve them. The rest of us will distract him! Move move move!\u201d The copters rush forward, their blades cutting through the air. As they draw closer to Michael\u2019s huge body, a stench fills the air. It reeked of unwashed man, a putrid aroma that brought one soldier to his knees. \u201cShit! Their bodies are like natural gas mines! Be careful soldiers and put on your gas masks!\u201d the captain orders again. The soldiers reached into their gear boxes and pulled out masks, one for them and one for the pilot. \r\n\r\nMichael turns to walk towards Jason, the lake killer lost in his stomping spree. The shorter giant was overjoyed by the feeling of the insignificant structures popping under his feet. He switches up his stomping speeds, pressing slowly at times to feel the fear in people as their unavoidable doom comes falling on them from above. Other times he stomped fast to get the quick rush of the thrill of destruction along with sexual satisfaction. \r\n\r\n\u201cShit! What the fuck?!\u201d the captain screams over the radio, Michael suddenly appearing before the swarm, his mask a towering mountain that blocked their path. \u201cEvasive maneuverers!\u201d On the captain\u2019s order, the helicopters attempt to change direction, but it was already too late. Michael continued walking and his mask crashed into the airborne vehicles, destroying them and ending the lives of the soldiers inside of them. \r\n\r\nMichael grabs Jason by the ass, the hockey masked giant turning swiftly to face him. Michael continues despite the other murder\u2019s response, spreading the man\u2019s glutes and dumping the people and debris he gathered inside of him. \r\n\r\nMany of the people tossed inside Jason\u2019s ass were crushed by the buildings left along with them. About a hundred people remained alive, a third of which had already quickly passed out from the overwhelming rankness of the man\u2019s swamp ass. Those still conscious scatter about and run on the sticky ground, some slipping on the slick parts of skin that were wet with ass sweat. \r\n\r\nMichael looks at Jason, the two communicating in silence. They continue like this until Jason gives a begrudging nod. With his permission, Michael begins to grow massive, the shape increasing in height by 3 miles. Jason was under crotch level to him now, the smaller giant forced to look up at Michael. The larger giant leans down and pushes Jason onto his back, flattening a good portion of the city beneath him. \r\n\r\nHalf of a street is crushed under the weight of Jason\u2019s manhood while a road is demolished under his hard and hefty pecs. No one manages to escape in time, leading distant onlookers to come to terms that their chances of survival were zero. \r\n\r\nMichael crushes a few blocks of city under his feet and more under his frame as he lies on the ground. He licks his index finger and slides it against Jason\u2019s ass, the smaller giant quivering in response, sending a low magnitude quake through the city. The shape proceeds to insert his massive finger into Jason\u2019s asshole, crushing many of the people inside the passage. He shoves slowly, moving deeper with each thrust, causing Jason to begin to moan. It starts as a low groan at first before Michael adds another finger in the giant\u2019s ass and picks up speed, thrusting faster, his wet fingers mashing the man\u2019s prostate and tickling his insides. Soon, Jason is moaning loudly, unable to contain his immense pleasure. \r\n\r\nThe city shakes as Jason humps the ground, creating an 8.9 magnitude earthquake that sends buildings crumbling to the ground. Anything that somehow managed to survive under him was pulverized ten times over into an unrecognizable state. \r\n\r\n\u201cOH!\u201d Jason cries out in pleasure, the killer grabbing his cock to begin stroking. Michael pulls away and lifts himself up slightly, situating his cock on the hockey masked giant\u2019s back. He moves his engorged penis up and down the expanse of Jason\u2019s muscular back, growing harder as he feels the bumpy skin. Once finished, he moves his penis inside Jason\u2019s anal cavity, the wet and warm passage working to take his length. Jason claws at the earth, destroying more of the city beneath his calloused hands. Then, Michael pulls out slightly before moving in deeper. The smaller giant slams his fist into the earth, causing more destruction. Finally, the shape begins to find a rhythm and picks up pace, jerking Jason\u2019s body like a ragdoll. The hockey masked man feels the shape smashing his insides, his prostate trembling, his passage quaking, and his usually slow heart was beating faster than it ever had before.\r\n\r\nA disgusting sound of wet manhood penetrating a tight asshole made itself clear for all the people of the city to hear. The squelching and squishing, the heavy moans, the shaking of the earth, it was too much. More than that, the heat generated from the now sweaty bodies of the giant\u2019s was spreading over Vineland, turning people into worshippers the moment they caught a hint of the scent. They began rushing towards the horny goliaths, pushing and shoving each other, flipping cars, doing anything they possibly could to reach them as fast as possible. \r\n\r\n\u201cAHH!\u201d Jason screams, his voice muffled by his mask. Michael rolls over, forcing the smaller killer to ride his cock. He thrusts harder into him, watching Jason squirm under his power. He smirks behind his mask, reaching up one of his hands to pinch the lake killer\u2019s nipple. \u201cMMF!\u201d Jason moans, biting his lip. He starts growing to a size that matches Michael\u2019s, ending up just slightly shorter than him. Michael groans at Jason trying to match him and begins increasing in size as well, crushing more city beneath his expanding form. The two continue to grow at a rapid pace, everything around them seeming to vanish from sight as the two become lost in ecstasy. \r\n\r\nMichael thrusts faster, sending quakes throughout the nearby cities. His body was now covering all that used to be Vineland and was starting to spread over other cities and places at a staggering rate. Newfield, Franklin, Buena, Clayton, all were wiped out by the massive soles and deadly toes of the giant. The places he didn\u2019t instantly reach were soon cast in a fog of his hypnotizing foot musk like the college students that first smelled them. Within a minute, Michael covered all of Cumberland County and was expanding to the other County\u2019s at a frightening pace.\r\n\r\nMichael flips Jason onto the ground, the two unable to stop themselves from growing now. They engage in a battle for dominance, Jason struggling to force Michael down. He manages to push the shape down slightly, but he was too winded from penetration, his feet sinking deeper into the cities below, leaving large footprints in place of bustling communities. Aircrafts swarm the two oversized killers, the passengers snapping photos and recording live video of the lovemaking.\r\n\r\nMichael forces Jason down, the hockey masked killer annihilating Atlantic County under his ass alone. The people beneath the sky of muscle attempt to rush to the pulsing and precum stained walls to try and get a taste, but all are swiftly crushed beneath the ass of the titan as Michael turns Jason on his back. \r\n\r\nMichael holds Jason steady and starts thrusting inside his passage again, keeping him locked in place. The shadow of the lake killer\u2019s swinging cock looms over the next county, the organ coming into view of the horrified people that quickly devolve into horny messes, pale imitations of their previously sane selves. A third of the county is destroyed under the hard manhood of the giant, pre sputtering out of it upon contacting the hard ground. This pre proceeds to leak into the next county, the tidal wave of body fluid consuming everything in its path, swallowing a massive number of people within it, leading to their untimely demise. \r\n\r\n\u201cAAH!\u201d Jason\u2019s booming voice shakes the counties of other states as Jersey quakes under the colliding bodies of the two titans. The giants were now half the size of the state and quickly starting to exceed it. The pounding of wet flesh causes a mix of responses amongst the people that heard it, some growing sick, others growing aroused, and some passing out. \r\n\r\nJason\u2019s cock reached its peak of arousal and his ass clenched tightly around Michael\u2019s length. The shape was ready as well, blood swelling to his head in ecstasy. With a final push, Michael triggers a roar that nearly shakes the entire planet. \r\n\r\n\u201cAHHHHHH!\u201d Jason bellows loudly, a shout of pleasure heard the world over. He cums, his seed spreading across what remained of Jersey. People are crushed under the increasing layers of seed that drop off the land and into the sea. Those who weren\u2019t crushed were consumed by the slowly moving mass. White envelops the state, leaving not one person left. \r\n\r\nAt the same time Jason released, Michael did the same, filling the man\u2019s ass with his cum. Even after he finishes his climax, his body instinctively continues thrusting until it ran out of energy to do so. Once both men are finished, Jason collapses into Michael\u2019s chest, breathing heavily. The shape embraces the Scourge of the Lake in a gentle hold, stroking the back of his head caringly. The two were exhausted, unaware of the destruction they had caused and were still currently causing. Nearby states had their buildings beginning to collapse, windows broken, eardrums popped, and homes destroyed. Humanity would not recover from this devastation, and what was worse, the giants were still growing. They couldn\u2019t stop anymore, and no power on earth could hold them back. People could only hope they remained asleep.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "macrobara", "subreddit_id": "t5_u328l", "subreddit_subscribers": 4200, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Jason and Michael Take Jersey PT 2", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/macrobara/comments/qspa4n/jason_and_michael_take_jersey_pt_2/"}

I had been sort of looking forward to retiring. I did sort of want to stay. I'm making $10,000 a month working full time from home so its worth the effort. I just don't need the money and want to do a few things to help others before I croak or am too old and screwed up to help. With all my disabilities I will NOT age gracefully. I'll die soon and quick without warning. Something vital will suddenly and without warning blow up in my engine room. I will spiral from orbit, crash into a planet and leave a healthy crater metaphorically speaking.\n\nIf I am going to leave a legacy of hope I need to get started now. That is what is driving me to retire. However the outpouring of emotion by my NT human coworkers has made parting a bitter sweet affair. I knew people liked and respected me but I never for a moment thought the love ran so deep. I find that I am NOT prepared for the emotional conflicts and turmoil this has awakened in me.\n\nAs an autistic werewolf I have hardened myself to being hated. I expect abuse, harsh words and worse and I feel vindicated when they arrive on cue. However this tidal wave of love and kindness I am experiencing during the last weeks of my career is strangely disconcerting in ways too numerous to convey. Has any of you ever been overloaded by happiness? Have any of you experienced the strange melancholy of confusion when you expect hate and love comes instead?\n\nI feel like crap because, I finally found true friends the one thing I always wanted and now in retirement I am leaving them for a greater calling. This hurts so damned much. Any help. Any insight would do me a world of good.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aspergers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rm6u", "subreddit_subscribers": 108382, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I Dread Retiring!

The 31.99 one includes the latest file + access to all future updates plus a tutorial written by me showing you how to upgrade Spotify accounts to premium!\n\nSee all my vouches at the bottom of the post\n\n**See my personal earnings here -** [**https://ibb.co/album/0KKnTS**](https://ibb.co/album/0KKnTS)\n\nI have been selling this guide for over a year, and have received over 900 orders and over 90+ five star reviews. With a track record like that, you can't go wrong!\n\n    &amp;nbsp; \n\n# Who am I?\n\nI am a professional account seller that has been selling accounts since 2017, with thousands in sales. I am selling a guide which includes everything you need to get any account for free and sell them. What this means is this guide is the summary of all that experience, not someone on the outside looking in. I have written it using my own experience, and continue to update it.\n\nI also saw a comment that said \"Your earnings are 4 years old, how is that relevant\". I thought that was a fair point, so I started a new shop this year just to show I know what I'm talking about. Both on the process, and earnings. You can [view them here](https://ibb.co/album/0KKnTS). I made around 330 USD in 21 days, and made more money selling on my first day than the cost of this guide. Just by following the guide, and promoting on the websites I mention in the guide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What am I selling?\n\nI am selling a guide that is a compilation of all my experience in my years of account selling I include the process, links and tips to make sure you get it right. I also include a custom video tutorial I created to make it even easier to follow, since I have found it is easier to copy a video when setting something up than having to constantly refer to text instructions. **My guide is also constantly updated to reflect the changing scene. This means that you will NEVER purchase my guide to see dead links and outdated information.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why should I trust you? What makes this guide unique?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFair question! If you're paying for something, you want to make sure it is quality. What separates this from anything else is I wrote this myself, and since I know the process well, I include things that others just watching the process would not know about. As well, I constantly update it. Things change, sellers go out of business, tools change. The guide you buy needs to reflect this.\n\nAs well, I have successfully followed this guide. Not only on the process, but on the selling part as well. This is the perspective of someone who has actually done it before. I have years of experience selling accounts, and this method is the summary of all that experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What does this guide include?\n\n**Everything you need to know to get any account for free**\n\n*\u200b Configurations for popular sites*\n\n*Step by step instructions + the program needed*\n\n*Friendly support from me if needed* *:)*\n\n*All future updates so it never goes out of date (only on 21.99 version)*\n\n*Insider tips and tricks + premium resources*\n\n*Detailed instructions on how to sell, where to sell, and what to sell for maximum profit (what I followed for my earnings)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What accounts can I get ?\n\n*I include program instructions for services like NordVPN, HBO MAX, Spotify, Crunchyroll, Deezer, Hulu, ExpressVPN, McDonald's, ESPN, Tunnelbear, Netflix, Tidal + loads more. The method works for many more accounts. I just can't include every single one out there! This is the method the sellers use*\n\n*Plus, I include exclusive resources that I have found and used giving you access to thousands of sites and services, so if you want a site, chances are I include it!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Sounds great, but what if I run into issues? Do you offer support?\n\n*I am there to help! It is pretty straightforward, and I explain it step by step, but if you need anything at all, I am here to help! Any questions or clarification before buying or after are always welcome! I have even gone on a discord call once to help someone out with installing on their particular system.

With a track record like that, you can't go wrong!\n\n    &amp;nbsp; \n\n# Who am I?\n\nI am a professional account seller that has been selling accounts since 2017, with thousands in sales. I am selling a guide which includes everything you need to get any account for free and sell them. What this means is this guide is the summary of all that experience, not someone on the outside looking in. I have written it using my own experience, and continue to update it.\n\nI also saw a comment that said \"Your earnings are 4 years old, how is that relevant\". I thought that was a fair point, so I started a new shop this year just to show I know what I'm talking about. Both on the process, and earnings. You can [view them here](https://ibb.co/album/0KKnTS). I made around 330 USD in 21 days, and made more money selling on my first day than the cost of this guide. Just by following the guide, and promoting on the websites I mention in the guide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What am I selling?\n\nI am selling a guide that is a compilation of all my experience in my years of account selling I include the process, links and tips to make sure you get it right. I also include a custom video tutorial I created to make it even easier to follow, since I have found it is easier to copy a video when setting something up than having to constantly refer to text instructions. **My guide is also constantly updated to reflect the changing scene. This means that you will NEVER purchase my guide to see dead links and outdated information.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why should I trust you? What makes this guide unique?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFair question! If you're paying for something, you want to make sure it is quality. What separates this from anything else is I wrote this myself, and since I know the process well, I include things that others just watching the process would not know about. As well, I constantly update it. Things change, sellers go out of business, tools change. The guide you buy needs to reflect this.\n\nAs well, I have successfully followed this guide. Not only on the process, but on the selling part as well. This is the perspective of someone who has actually done it before. I have years of experience selling accounts, and this method is the summary of all that experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What does this guide include?\n\n**Everything you need to know to get any account for free**\n\n*\u200b Configurations for popular sites*\n\n*Step by step instructions + the program needed*\n\n*Friendly support from me if needed* *:)*\n\n*All future updates so it never goes out of date (only on 21.99 version)*\n\n*Insider tips and tricks + premium resources*\n\n*Detailed instructions on how to sell, where to sell, and what to sell for maximum profit (what I followed for my earnings)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What accounts can I get ?\n\n*I include program instructions for services like NordVPN, HBO MAX, Spotify, Crunchyroll, Deezer, Hulu, ExpressVPN, McDonald's, ESPN, Tunnelbear, Netflix, Tidal + loads more. The method works for many more accounts. I just can't include every single one out there! This is the method the sellers use*\n\n*Plus, I include exclusive resources that I have found and used giving you access to thousands of sites and services, so if you want a site, chances are I include it!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Sounds great, but what if I run into issues? Do you offer support?\n\n*I am there to help! It is pretty straightforward, and I explain it step by step, but if you need anything at all, I am here to help! Any questions or clarification before buying or after are always welcome! I have even gone on a discord call once to help someone out with installing on their particular system.

I also include a custom video tutorial I created to make it even easier to follow, since I have found it is easier to copy a video when setting something up than having to constantly refer to text instructions. **My guide is also constantly updated to reflect the changing scene. This means that you will NEVER purchase my guide to see dead links and outdated information.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why should I trust you?

What separates this from anything else is I wrote this myself, and since I know the process well, I include things that others just watching the process would not know about. As well, I constantly update it. Things change, sellers go out of business, tools change. The guide you buy needs to reflect this.\n\nAs well, I have successfully followed this guide. Not only on the process, but on the selling part as well. This is the perspective of someone who has actually done it before.
